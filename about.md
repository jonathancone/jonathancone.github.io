I'm a full-stack software developer interested in all things Java, Linux, SQL, HTML 5, JavaScript and CSS.  I think everyone should use great tools like git, Jenkins and Sublime Text.

I've enjoyed working for companies with 2 employees all the way up to 120,000.  I've been forturnate to have people that use software I've written on every continent but Antarctica (still working on that one). 

When I'm not coding you might find me tickling my kids, playing softball or basketball or tinkering in my workshop.
